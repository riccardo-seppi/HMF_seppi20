HMF_seppi20
===================

Code developed for computation and fitting in Seppi et al. 2020

== physical directory==

- mean relations: mean relations between concentration, spin and Xoff,P with mass. Probability density distributions of concentration, spin, Xoff,P. 
- build and fit the mass-offset-spin-z function in physical units. 


== Rvir directory==

- xoff: offset-mass relation and distribution of xoff.
- build and fit the mass-offset-spin-z function normalized to the virial radius. 


todo: add more documentation
